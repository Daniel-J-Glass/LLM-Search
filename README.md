# LLM-Search
Applying LLMs to A* search

## Concept
Integrating flexible agents into classical AI algorithms should allow for more flexible and accurate systems.<br>
By generating an A* tree for agent traversal, you can enable intelligent goal seeking, and more importantly, derive optimal paths for future agent training.<br>

## Status
The agent is severely limitted by state representation, it can generate simple file structures and write basic Python scripts.<br>
Improvements in agent flexibility (i.e. AutoGPT) should allow for improved tree traversal, allowing for a smarter AutoGPT agent.<br>

## Goal
Implement Langchain agents for improved fault tolerance, flexibility, and memory.<br>
Store optimal A* path for future model training.
